                <p>I was just accepted to a bachelors program to study software development.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It had been a long journey so far.
                    God had brought me through a lot of interesting experiences and setbacks to bring me there. I
                    thought,
                    I want to share my journey towards software development. Maybe it can help someone else.
                    <br/>
                    <br />
                    I thought about only making it about me, but then I realized, maybe others would like to share their
                    journeys too. Maybe there is more than one journey they would like to share with their family,
                    friends,
                    a future employer..
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Maybe people dream of taking a journey, and they've never shared it. Maybe people could share
                    stories of
                    journeys that they've never taken, but are in their dreams.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    That is when I knew I needed to give others the opportunity to share their journeys too. That is when I
                    began working on this app. That is why this exists.
