# MyJourney

This is a fun app I built in order to share my own life journey towards software development. 

You can view the live website at [myjourney.page](https://myjourney.page).

I was also hoping to make this open to others in order to help with hosting cost and pay for my college. At this point, I don't think user adoption is going to be as good as I thought it was going to be. haha (:
